# Introduction

## Roar?

Roar is my latest update to a hybrid engine design code, moving from MATLAB to Python. And to provide \(much\) better documentation on how it works.

It allows you to:

* define the performance targets of an engine
* perform an initial sizing for an engine, defining the most important dimensions for an engine
* analyse the expected performance of an engine, running a full time-domain simuation. 

What it does not do:

* build an engine. Thats your job
* guarantee that it works - if you 'accidentally' use a diameter instead of a radius \(or vice versa\) it _will_ give you an answer, but the answer will not work in real life - use your brain, use your engineering judgement.
* make the right assumptions - I've put in the best assumptions that I had available when I wrote the code. Please update the code to make it better. 



How to get started: 

1. Read Background on Hybrids
2. Follow Getting Started

I assume a basic understanding of python, but not much more. The level of physics/thermo background needed is also low to use the tool, but not insignificant to develop new models.  



How to make it better: \(use this as a scratchpad of features to add\)

* [ ] better mathematical/thermo models for hybrid
  * [ ] better nitrous modelling.
* [ ] a module to integrate test results
