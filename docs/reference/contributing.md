# Contributing to Roar

## Help is really appreciated!

I would love for your efforts and insights to be a part of this project! There are many areas you can help in:

1. Developing the code base to be easier, better, faster, etc
2. Helping with the documentation - both on the theory and the code documentation
3. Suggesting new improvements!

## How to contribute to code/documentation:

1. Fork the original project
2. Make a branch for the code you want to commit to the main
3. Develop your improvements
4. Push them to your fork
5. Raise a Pull Request
6. A core-contributor will review the changes and we might make some suggestions for things to change or style to improve - don't worry we are learning together! This isnt meant to critique your work, but to bring all our efforts together!
7. Once approved, we will merge the changes in, and everyone will have access to your changes!
