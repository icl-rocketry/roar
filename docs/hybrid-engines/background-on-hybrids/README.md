# Background on Hybrids

## Why is it called a 'hybrid'?



This entire project is based on SPAD:

"Space Propulsion Analysis and Design" by Ronald Humble. 

There are definitely more \(and possibly better\) resources, but Humble was rather easy to follow, and thus was implemented. Dont forget: the primary objective of this code is to be a guide. It is not the single source of truth.

1. Figure out what you want out of the engine.
2. Make a guess
3. Check if your guess gave you a rocket that works
